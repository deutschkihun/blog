온라인 SQL 컴파일러를 이용하여 cheat sheet 를 작성해보겠습니다. 작성되는 모든 데이터들은 아래 링크에 설정되어있는 테이블을 기준으로 한다는 점 참고 부탁드립니다.

## 1.Querying tables

```tsx
SELECT * FROM Customers;
SELECT * FROM Orders;
SELECT * FROM Shippings;
```

```tsx
SELECT first_name FROM Customers;
SELECT item FROM Orders;
SELECT status FROM Shippings;
```

```tsx
SELECT first_name,last_name FROM Customers;
SELECT item,amount FROM Orders;
SELECT status,customer FROM Shippings;
```

```tsx
SELECT first_name,age FROM Customers
ORDER BY age ASC;

SELECT item,amount FROM Orders
ORDER BY amount DESC;
```

```tsx
SELECT DISTINCT country FROM Customers;
```

## 2.Filtering Data

```tsx
SELECT * FROM Customers
WHERE age >=23;
```

```tsx
SELECT * FROM Orders
WHERE amount BETWEEN 350 AND 500;
```

```tsx
SELECT * FROM Customers
WHERE country = 'USA';

SELECT * FROM Customers
WHERE country != 'USA'

SELECT * FROM Customers
WHERE country IN ('USA', 'UK');
```

```tsx
SELECT *
FROM Orders
WHERE item LIKE 'm%' AND item NOT LIKE '%e';
```

```tsx
SELECT *
FROM Shippings
WHERE status = 'Pending' AND shipping_id > 1;
```

```tsx
SELECT *
FROM Customers
WHERE country = 'UK' OR age > 22;
```

```tsx
SELECT *
FROM Customers
WHERE age IS NOT NULL;

SELECT *
FROM Customers
WHERE age IS NULL;
```

## 3.Aggregating Data

- SUM
- AVG
- MAX
- MIN

```tsx
SELECT MIN(age)
FROM Customers;

SELECT AVG(age)
FROM Customers;


SELECT SUM(age)
FROM Customers;


SELECT MAX(age)
FROM Customers;
```

```tsx
SELECT country, AVG(age)
FROM Customers
GROUP BY country;
```

```tsx
SELECT country, AVG(age) AS avg_age
FROM Customers
GROUP BY country
ORDER BY avg_age DESC;
```

```tsx
SELECT status
FROM Shippings
GROUP BY status
HAVING COUNT(shipping_id) > 2;
```

```tsx
SELECT country, MAX(age)
FROM Customers
WHERE country IN ('USA','UK')
GROUP BY country;
```

```tsx
SELECT country, COUNT(country) AS number_of_countries
FROM Customers
GROUP BY country;
```

## 4.Join tables

```tsx
// 차집합 A-B
SELECT * FROM TableA A
LEFT JOIN TableB B ON
A.key = B.key WHERE B.key IS NULL
```

```tsx
//차집합 B-A
SELECT * FROM TableA A
RIGHT JOIN TableB B ON
A.key = B.key WHERE A.key IS NULL
```

```tsx
// 교집합 A∩B
SELECT * FROM TableA A
INNER JOIN TableB B ON
A.key = B.key
```

```tsx
// 합집합 A∪B
SELECT * FROM TableA A
FULL OUTER JOIN TableB B ON
A.key = B.key
```

```tsx
// 합집합-교집합 A∪B-A∩B
SELECT * FROM TableA A
FULL OUTR JOIN TableB B ON
A.key = B.key WHERE A.key IS NULL
OR B.key IS NULL
```
